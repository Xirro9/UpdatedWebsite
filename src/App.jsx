            My background combines hands-on cybersecurity education with real assessment experience in environments where security requirements must be explained, validated, and defended. I am especially interested in the space where governance, risk, compliance, and practical security operations overlap. Whether I am reviewing policies, mapping controls, building labs, or validating infrastructure, I focus on one core idea: security should be understandable, testable, and grounded in how systems actually work.
